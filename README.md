# [Java Notes](http://java.ramswaroop.me)

My Java notes jotted down from some of the best books in Java __(SCJP Java, Thinking in Java,
Effective Java, Java Puzzlers and of course JLS)__ and published as a blog with help of the awesome
__Github's Jekyll__.

It attempts to demystify some of the most misunderstood concepts in **Java** which may confound
even many experienced java programmers.

In short, this blog is for those who have been coding in **Java** for a while (**and not for greenhorns**) who
can **contribute** too by simply sending a pull request.
