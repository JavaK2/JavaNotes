title: Threads

A __Thread__ in Java means two different things:

* An instance of class `java.lang.Thread`
* A thread of execution

An __instance of Thread__ is just an object. Like any other object in Java, it has variables and methods, and lives and
dies on the heap. But a __thread of execution__ is an individual process (a "lightweight" process) that has its own call
stack.

In Java, there is one thread per call stack or you can say, one call stack per thread. Even if you don't create any new 
threads in your program, threads are back there running. The main() method, that starts the whole ball rolling, runs in
one thread, called (surprisingly) the main thread.

### Two ways to create a Thread in Java

* Extend the `java.lang.Thread` class
* Implement the `Runnable` interface
